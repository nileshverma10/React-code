        What is a blog post? A blog post is an individual web page on your
        website that dives into a particular sub-topic of your blog. For
        instance, let's say you start a fashion blog on your retail website. One
        blog post might be titled, "The Best Fall Shoes for 2019". The post ties
        back to your overall blog topic as a whole (fashion), but it also
        addresses a very particular sub-topic (fall shoes). Blog posts allow you
        to rank on search engines for a variety of keywords. In the above
        example, your blog post could enable your business to rank on Google for
        "fall shoes". When someone searches for fall shoes and comes across your
        blog post, they have access to the rest of your company's website. They
        might click "Products" after they read your post, and take a look at the
        clothing items your company sells. A blog post links back to your
        overall blog site. For instance, right now, you're on
        blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog. The "what-is-a-blog" section
        of the URL is tied back to /marketing/, which is the blog as a whole.
